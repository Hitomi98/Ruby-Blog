RUBY ON RAILS NOTES

Arrays are as simple as declaring
	   mynumbers = [4 ,5, 6, 3, 23, 1]

Hashes
	user = {
			'first_name' => 'john',
		   	'last_name' => 'smith'
			}

	Some Hash Methods:
		 user.sort
		 user.sort

	Can Create Arrays Of Hashes

Loops
	5.times {}		 # executes everything inside curly braces 5 times
	4.upto(9) {}	 # executes everything inside curly braces 5 times
	7.downto(2) {}   # executes everything inside curly braces 5 times

	While Loops (self explanatory)
	For/Each Loops
		planets = ['Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter']
		planets.each{|x| puts x} # will print out each value in the array

Rails App Framework
	Now we're going over the file structure of rails
	root/
		app/ # this is where the main directory where most of our code lives
